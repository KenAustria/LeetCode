SLIDING WINDOW
  What Data Structures To Use On:
    arrays, linked list, strings
  Why Use This Technique:
    • brute force approach performs double traversals over values already iterated, results in time complexity of O(n^2)
    • decreases time complexity by performing linear traversals
  Candidate For Technique
    • contiguous sequence of elements
    • calculations (i.e. = min, max, longest, shortest, contained within)

/*
The algorithm takes three parameters:
    start: The starting node of the search
    target: The node we want to find
    neighbors: A function that takes a node as input and returns an array of its neighboring nodes
        The algorithm uses a queue to keep track of nodes to process. It also keeps track of visited nodes using a set to avoid processing the same node multiple times.

    Inside the while loop, the algorithm processes the current node and adds its neighbors to the queue. If the target node is found, the
algorithm returns the result. If the queue becomes empty before finding the target, the algorithm returns the result indicating that the
target was not found.
